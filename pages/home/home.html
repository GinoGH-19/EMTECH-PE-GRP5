    This calculator was coded and designed on April 30, 2021 by Grade 12 students from La Salle Green Hills as part of the subject Empowerment and Technology requirements. The calorie calculator is based on the Mifflin - St Jeor equation. It allows you to find your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) - the amount of energy needed for your body to support only its basic vital functions. It differs for men and women.
